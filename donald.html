   <p>President-elect Donald Trump has proposed sweeping reforms for the United States' educational systems. He has reportedly vowed to shut down the federal Department of Education and relegate all educational responsibility to individual states.

    Trump's Agenda47 campaign proposed eliminating the Department of Education- which as per the DOE website, "establishes policy for, administers and coordinates most federal assistance to education." This move by Trump could impact crucial funding for K-12 schools and hamper civil rights enforcement, reported The Forbes.
    The Department of Education, established by President Jimmy Carter, provides programs such as Title I funding for low-achieving or high-poverty K-12 schools in need of support, as well as Pell Grants for undergraduate students in high financial need. During the first tenure, Donald Trump proposed billions in cuts to the DOE's budget. The Republican's richest backer, billionaire Elon Musk, thinks it's a 'good idea'.
    Trump to eliminate Department of Education
    Trump has called the DOE "an example of government oversight into the daily lives of Americans", reported The Forbes. He has suggested that DOE has been a poor investment for taxpayers, claiming the US spends three times more money than any other nation and "yet we are absolutely at the bottom", we are one of the worst, the report said.
    
    Last year in a video message, Trump baselessly claimed the DOE is staffed by many people who "in many cases, hate our children" and said “we want states to run the education of our children, because they’ll do a much better job of it. You can’t do worse," the report said.
    
    In Agenda47, closing the DOE has been outlined, the proposals the Trump campaign outlined during the primary election season. Trump has also outlined plans to further restrict classroom discussion in schools based on guidelines that would be executed at the federal level.
    While closing the Department of Education seems to be high on the priority list for Trump, his Agenda47 proposals surrounding education also outline orders for schools—like cutting funding for any school teaching critical race theory or "transgender insanity" and credentialing teachers who "embrace patriotic values and support the American Way of Life"—that would no longer be the federal government's purview if all responsibilities were handed back to the states.

Trump on educational overhaul
Donald Trump on Tuesday said it is time to reclaim America's educational institutions from the radical Left, adding that the accreditation system will be used to achieve this end. After assuming presidency on January 20, he will fire "radical Left" accreditors that have allowed colleges to be dominated by "Marxists, maniacs and lunatics", Trump said.

In an over two-minute-long statement, Donald Trump accused academics of being obsessed with indoctrinating America's youth, while tuition fees continue to skyrocket.
